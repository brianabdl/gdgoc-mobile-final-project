# 📱 GDGOC UNESA Final Project – Mobile Development

Hey Developers! 👋

After an exciting journey through our **Mobile Development Learning Series**, where we explored the fundamentals of Android development together, it's finally time to level up!

Over the past sessions, we've built a strong foundation—from Introduction to Android, Java, and Handling lifecycle resource. It’s been a pleasure mentoring such passionate learners like you guys.

Now, it’s your turn to shine. 🚀  
Theory is important, but as i say: **"The best way to learn is by building."**

This final project is your chance to **combine creativity with technical skills** to craft your very own Android application. Whether it’s something useful, fun, or innovative—the canvas is yours.
